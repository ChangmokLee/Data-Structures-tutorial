# Python Data Structures Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial. In this tutorial, we will discuss the importance of data structures in programming and cover three specific data structures: Stack, Linked List, and Tree.

## Importance of Data Structures

Data structures are crucial in programming as they organize, manage, and store data efficiently. They enable programmers to perform operations on data in a more efficient manner.

## Covered Data Structures

In this tutorial, we will be covering the following data structures:

# Data Structure 3: Tree

## Introduction to Trees

A Tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure.

## Tree Terminology

Some important terminologies related to trees are nodes, edges, root, parent, child, and leaf.

## Types of Trees

We will be covering the following types of trees:

- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Balanced Trees

## Tree Traversal

There are three common ways to traverse trees in a depth-first order:

- Pre-order
- In-order
- Post-order

## Example

Here we will demonstrate implementing a binary search tree and performing basic operations.
