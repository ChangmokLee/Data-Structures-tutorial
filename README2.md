# Data Structure 2: Linked List

## Introduction to Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

## Implementing a Linked List

Linked lists can be implemented using nodes and references.

## Linked List Operations

The primary operations of a linked list are:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal

## Example

Here we will demonstrate implementing a linked list and performing basic operations.
